# Text To Speech

Text-to-Speech (TTS) is a technology that converts written text into natural-sounding audio.  
In this project, I used a **built-in Web API** provided by the browser called `SpeechSynthesisUtterance`, part of the **Web Speech API**.

Users interact with a simple UI to configure values like the message, pitch, rate, and voice model.

## 🎛️ UI and Controls

- Select a voice model from the available options,
- Adjust the pitch and rate if needed 🎚️,
- Type the message you want to convert to speech ✍️,
- Press play, and the browser will speak it for you ✅.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Web Speech API: `SpeechSynthesisUtterance`
